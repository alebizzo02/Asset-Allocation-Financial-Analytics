Asset Allocation – Multi-Factor Financial Analysis

Overview

This project develops a structured multi-factor framework to evaluate U.S. equities across valuation, growth, profitability, capital efficiency, and risk dimensions.

The objective is not simply to compare companies, but to construct portfolios tailored to different risk profiles using an integrated factor approach grounded in financial logic.

The analysis covers:
	•	Amazon (AMZN)
	•	Alphabet (GOOGL)
	•	Meta (META)
	•	Nvidia (NVDA)
	•	Walmart (WMT)
	•	Home Depot (HD)

Investment Question

How can fundamental and risk-based metrics be combined to:
	•	Identify relative mispricing
	•	Distinguish growth leaders from value names
	•	Evaluate business quality via ROIC and margins
	•	Construct Conservative, Moderate, and Growth portfolios
	•	Improve risk-adjusted allocation decisions

⸻

Factor Framework

The model integrates eight key indicators:

Valuation
	•	Price/Earnings
	•	EV/EBITDA

Growth
	•	5-Year Revenue CAGR

Profitability
	•	Net Margin
	•	ROIC

Risk
	•	Beta
	•	Expected Return
	•	Volatility

⸻

Methodology

The analytical workflow follows a structured bottom-up process:
	1.	Individual factor scoring
	2.	Cross-sectional comparison
	3.	Integrated composite evaluation
	4.	Portfolio construction based on expected return and correlation
	5.	Risk-return efficiency assessment

All modeling was built in Excel, with interactive visualization and scenario comparison developed in Power BI.

Key Insights
	•	Nvidia dominates across growth, margins, and capital efficiency, positioning it as a structural growth leader.
	•	Google and Meta combine strong profitability with moderate valuation, representing high-quality core holdings.
	•	Walmart and Home Depot display lower volatility and more stable fundamentals, suitable for conservative allocations.
	•	High P/E multiples do not necessarily imply overvaluation when supported by strong ROIC and growth dynamics.
	•	Portfolio construction benefits significantly from factor diversification rather than single-metric screening.

Portfolio Construction

Three portfolios were simulated:

Conservative
Focus on stability, lower beta, and margin consistency

Moderate
Balanced exposure across growth and value

Growth
High allocation to high-CAGR, high-ROIC equities

Risk-return tradeoffs were evaluated using expected return vs volatility positioning.

Tools Used
